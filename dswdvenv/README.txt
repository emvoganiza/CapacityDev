NOTES on how to run the program

Step1: Create a List of attendees
    1. Create a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary 
    represents an attendee's information. Include the following 
    fields: "Name," "Age," and "City."
    2. The list should contain at least 10 attendees.
    3. Save the attendee information to a CSV file named 
    "attendees.csv."

Step 2: Load and Update Attendee List
    1. Load the attendee information from the "attendees.csv" CSV 
    file.
    2. Remove the last five attendees from the list.

Step 3: Resave Updated Attendee List
    1. Save the updated attendee list (without the last five 
    attendees) back to the "attendees.csv" CSV file.
